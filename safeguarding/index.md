# Safeguarding Policy

Our organisation acknowledges the duty of care to safeguard and promote the welfare of its members and is committed to ensuring safeguarding practice reflects statutory responsibilities, government guidance and complies with best practices.

## Introduction

We firmly believe that practising traditional martial arts helps to improve self-confidence while learning self-defence. We strive to provide a safe, fair, and welcoming environment for everyone.

Our instructors have a moral and legal responsibility to ensure that the highest possible standard of care is provided regarding children, young people, and vulnerable adults. Our lessons, therefore, incorporate the necessary procedures to protect children and/or vulnerable adults. These procedures include reporting any concerns about the welfare of individuals to the appropriate authorities without delay.

This policy aims to promote good practice during Karate lessons and associated training or development sessions. Adopting this practice will enable our instructors to comply with their moral and legal safeguarding obligations. It also aims to demonstrate our commitment to safeguarding and assure our members and responsible persons of this.

## Policy Statement

The club is committed to safeguarding children, young people, and vulnerable adults.  We are committed to the following priorities concerning safeguarding at all times:

* Prioritising the welfare of children, young people and/or vulnerable adults.
* Providing a safe environment for everyone regardless of age, culture, ability, gender, language, racial origin, religious belief, sexual identity.
* Ensuring that all members take reasonable steps to protect children, young people, and/or vulnerable adults from harm, discrimination, or degrading treatment.
* Ensuring that all members treat other students and visitors with respect, dignity and care at all times.
* Responding to and recording any suspicious behaviour, allegations of abuse, or poor practice.
* Ensuring that our instructors are aware of their safeguarding responsibilities and reflect the content of this policy.
* Maintaining a positive, open, transparent and professional relationship with the parents, or guardians of any student.
* Promoting a positive culture and reinforcing our values of fitness, confidence, respect, and discipline.

## Monitoring and Review

The Club will continually monitor this safeguarding policy to ensure its currency with legislation and best practice. The Club will review the policy at least once every three years, and any occasion where there are fundamental changes made to the Clubâ€™s structure.

##Promoting Good Practice

The club expects all of its members and visitors to conduct themselves ethically. All registered members will adhere to the following principles and actions regarding safeguarding children, young people, and/or vulnerable adults:

* Treating all children (anyone younger than 18 years), and all vulnerable adults with respect, dignity and courtesy.
* Valuing the diversity of all children and/or vulnerable adults.
* Prioritising the welfare of children and/or vulnerable adults.
* Maintaining an open environment and avoiding any isolation, or unobserved situations.
* Keeping physical contact to an absolute minimum.
* Avoid individuals to be alone with a child and/or vulnerable adult.
* Ensuring that any physical contact only occurs when it is essential and as part of the safe and structured learning process. For example, elements of the self-defence and one-step fighting syllabus.
* Prohibiting anyone taking photographs, videos or sharing images of children and/or vulnerable adults without written consent from the parent, carer, or guardian.
* Instructors and senior students must present themselves as good role models inside and outside of the dojo. This includes refraining from smoking, drinking alcohol, using any foul language, or any other inappropriate behaviour in the presence of any children and/or vulnerable adults.
* Recognising the strengths and weaknesses of everyone and making necessary adjustments during lessons.
* Keeping thorough records of any injuries or near misses together with details of any Treatment.

## Poor Practice

The following are examples of what the Club deems poor practice regarding the safeguarding of children and/or vulnerable adults. All members must avoid such behaviour without exception:

* Spending an un-necessarily and/or excessive amount of time alone with a child and/or vulnerable adult.
* Making unnecessary physical contact with a child and/or vulnerable adult.
* Transporting or accompanying any children and/or vulnerable adults to any destination without the presence of another person.
* Engaging in physical or sexually provocative games, including horseplay before, during, or following lessons.
* Allowing or engaging in any inappropriate physical contact.
* Making any sexually suggestive comments to children and/or vulnerable adults.
* Reducing children and/or vulnerable adults to tears as a form of control.
* Purposely excluding anyone from particular elements of a lesson without adequate justification.
* Allowing any allegations made by a child and/or vulnerable adult to go unchallenged, and/or unrecorded.

## Photographic/Filming Equipment at Sporting Events or Within Lesson Venues

Unfortunately, some people exploit sporting events and use them as an opportunity to take inappropriate photographs or film footage of children or vulnerable adults. The club and its instructors will challenge any suspicious behaviour and report this accordingly to the relevant authorities.

The Club will only use photos or video footage of people on its website if prior permission to do so has been given by parents, guardians, or carers.

## Reporting Concerns

All suspicions and allegations must be reported appropriately without delay to the instructor. Steps will then be taken to safeguard the individual(s).
