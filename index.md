## Karate classes for children and adults

Our classes teach traditional Shotokan Karate in a friendly, structured environment where students of all ages can learn and grow. Children (8+), adults, and families train together in a supportive setting that encourages confidence, fitness, and respect. We welcome students from Northstowe, Longstanton, Willingham, Oakington, and the surrounding Cambridge area.

Karate is more than a martial art - it’s a way of developing confidence, focus, fitness, strength and resilience in a supportive community. At Northstowe Karate Club, we focus on helping every student progress at their own pace. Whether someone is completely new or returning after a break, we make sure they feel welcome from the moment they step through the door.

Parents often tell us they appreciate the balance we strike: structured, traditional training delivered in a friendly, encouraging environment. Students learn to work hard, support each other, and take pride in their achievements - skills that carry far beyond the dojo.

## Our Teaching Approach

We teach with a focus on clarity, encouragement, and respect — values that shape every lesson. For the full teaching approach and how it works in practice, see our [About page](/about/).

## What parents and students say about our classes

We’re proud of the positive experiences our students and their families share.
