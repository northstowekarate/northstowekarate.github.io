<h2> About </h2>
<p>
Northstowe Karate Club will open Wednesday 3rd July 2024, running a 10 week traditional Shotokan Karate course. Sessions will be held every Wednesday 1830-1930 at The Cabin. It's a family friendly club, where children (6+) and adults can both train together. You come to as many sessions as you like, but we recommend coming to as many as you can, so you get a good idea of what Shotokan Karate is all about.
