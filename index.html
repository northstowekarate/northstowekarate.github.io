<h2> About </h2>
<p>
Northstowe Karate Club will open in summer 2024, running a 10 week course teaching traditional Shotokan Karate. It's a family friendly club, where children and adults can both train together. You come to as many sessions as you like, but we recommend coming to as many as you can, so you get a good idea of what Shotokan Karate is all about.
