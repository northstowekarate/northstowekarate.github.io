# Frequently Asked Questions
Here are some of our frequently asked questions to help you find out more about karate, our club, what to expect. 

## When and where are lessons?
We train regularly at the Northstowe Community Centre. For more information on training times, view our [schedule](/training/).

## How much does it cost?
Your first class is free. After that, we offer pay-per-session plus annual membership. You can view a full breakdown of costs on our [fees](/training/fees/) page.

## Is Karate Right for me?

We welcome students of all backgrounds and abilities. Whether you're looking to improve your fitness, build confidence, or simply try something new, our inclusive approach ensures everyone feels supported. Parents and guardians are encouraged to train alongside younger children to help them settle in.

## It's my first lesson, what can I expect? 

For detailed information, please view our ["What to Expect" page](/training/what-to-expect/). In brief, your first lesson will introduce you to the basics of karate, including fundamental stances, punches, and kicks. You'll also learn about dojo etiquette and the importance of respect and discipline in martial arts. Our instructors will ensure you feel comfortable and supported throughout the session.

## What should I wear? 

You don't need a gi (karate uniform) to start. Please wear loose-fitting clothes to your first session. Comfortable athletic wear, such as a t-shirt and sweatpants, is ideal. As you progress, you may choose to invest in a gi, which can enhance your training experience and help you feel more integrated into the karate community.

## What should I bring?

You don't need any special equipment. We recommend you bring a water bottle to ensure you stay hydrated throughout the lesson.

## What are the age requirements? 
We teach both children and adults, aged 8 and above. Students aged 6-7 may be accepted after discussion with the instructor. There's no upper age limit, so it's never too late to start learning karate. We recommend that young children train alongside their parents for the first few sessions to build their confidence gradually. This family-oriented approach can also strengthen bonds and create a supportive learning environment.

## Will I get hurt? 

Karate is a martial art, and there are some risks involved. However, injuries are rare. JKA karate is non-contact, and you won't be expected to fight until you've mastered the basics. We build up the level of fighting gradually, starting off slowly with known attacks to develop technique and confidence. Safety is our top priority, and our instructors are trained to ensure that all activities are conducted in a controlled and safe manner.

## How do I join?

Please visit [book a class](/lesson-booking/) to find out how to book your first class. We are often fully booked so please reach out in advance.

## How do I get a uniform?

You can purchase karate gi (uniform) through the club, although this is not required. We generally recommend trying a few sessions first to make sure you enjoy the lessons before committing. I recommend one of the following:

* [Blitz Children's Beginner Karate gi](https://www.blitzsport.com/karate/karate-suits-uniforms/blitz-kids-lightweight-karate-gi)
* [Blitz Adults Beginner Karate gi](https://www.blitzsport.com/karate/karate-suits-uniforms/blitz-adult-lightweight-karate-gi)
* [Bytomic Children's Beginner karate gi](https://www.bytomic.com/products/white-bytomic-red-label-7oz-lightweight-kids-karate-uniform)
* [Bytomic Adult Beginner karate gi](https://www.bytomic.com/products/white-bytomic-red-label-7oz-lightweight-adult-karate-uniform)


## How do I get my next belt?

Gradings are practical assessments to check if you're ready for the next grade. These are held around 3 times per year. You can read the requirements for each kyu grade (colour belt) in our [kyu syllabus](/kyu-syllabus/).

## Why learn karate?

Karate improves fitness, confidence, focus and self‑defence skills within a supportive community.You can learn more on our [benefits of karate page](https://www.northstowekarate.com/benefits-of-karate/).
