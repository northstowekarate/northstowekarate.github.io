# The Dojo Kun - Rules of the Dojo

The dojo kun are five precepts for both inside and outside of the dojo. Here they are in both Japanese and their approximate translation: 

* Hitotsu, Jinkaku kansei ni tsutomuru koto
  * Seek perfection of character
* Hitotsu Makoto no michi o mamoru koto
  * Be sincere
* Hitotsu Doryoku no seishin o yashinau koto
  * Put maximum effort into everything you do
* Hitotsu Reigi o omonzuru koto
  * [Respect others](/etiquette/)
* Hitotsu Kekki no yuu o imashimuru koto
  * Develop self-control and refrain from violent behaviour
