# JSKE Kyu Grading Syllabus 

Karate students progress through a series of coloured belts, known as kyu grades, by demonstrating their skills in grading exams. Each grade has specific requirements for basic techniques, kata (forms), and kumite (sparring).

Gradings are held regularly throughout the year. Instructors provide support and guidance to help students prepare for each grading.

For details on upcoming gradings and how to prepare, speak to your instructor or check our club communications.
