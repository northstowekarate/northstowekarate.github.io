# The Dojo Kun - Rules of the Dojo

The dojo kun are five guiding principles that serve as a moral compass for martial artists, both inside and outside the dojo. These precepts are deeply rooted in the philosophy of martial arts and aim to cultivate a well-rounded character. Here they are in both Japanese and their approximate translations:

* 一、人格完成に努むること
  * Hitotsu, Jinkaku kansei ni tsutomuru koto
  * Seek perfection of character
* 一、誠の道を守ること
  * Hitotsu, Makoto no michi o mamoru koto
  * Be faithful
* 一、努力の精神を養うこと
  * Hitotsu, Doryoku no seishin o yashinau koto
  * Endeavour
* 一、礼儀を重んずること
  * Hitotsu, Reigi o omonzuru koto
  * Respect Others
* 一、血気の勇を戒むること
  * Hitotsu, Kekki no yuu o imashimuru koto
  * Refrain from violent behaviour

The term &quot;Hitotsu&quot; means &quot;one&quot; or &quot;first,&quot; emphasising that each precept is equally important. These principles encourage martial artists to strive for personal growth, integrity, and respect in all aspects of life. By adhering to the dojo kun, practitioners aim to become better individuals and contribute positively to society. This holistic approach to martial arts training helps in developing not just physical skills but also mental and moral strength.
