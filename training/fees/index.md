# Northstowe Karate Club Fees 
The first lesson is always free, so you can try it out and see if you enjoy the lesson. Prices are £4 per session for adults and £3 per session for children.

I'd like for families to be able train together and understand it can be expensive when training in a large group. To combat this I'm limiting the price to £10 for groups of 3 and £12 for groups of 4.

Payment by bank transfer is preferred. Please [contact us](/contact/) for details.

## Membership Fees

All students who train on a regular basis will need to join the [Japan Karate Association](https://www.jka.or.jp/en/) and get a license. License fees are is £35 / year, includes a license book, covers insurance and allows you to grade.

## Grading Fees

To get your next belt/grade you must take a grading. This consists of you performing your techniques in front of an examiner, who will asses if you have reached the required level. Fees will vary depending on where the grading takes places and may include a training session beforehand. Kyu gradings (colour belts) are approximately £25.

Dan gradings (black belt) generally require examiners from JKA HQ, and can be upwards of £100.

## Funding
Northstowe Karate Club has been awarded funding to help with the running costs of the club. The club wants to be as accessible as possible, and has allocated some of this funding towards helping those on lower incomes attend. We are able to fund up to 4 students with:

* 1 year annual membership
* A karate dogi (uniform) plus belt
* First grading

If you would like to apply, please [get in touch](/contact/) for a confidential conversation. The application will be self-assessed so no evidence will be required. Unfortunately, we cannot assist with lesson fees, but may be able to reach an agreement, so please get in touch.
