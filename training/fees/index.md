# Training, Membership and Grading Fees
The first lesson is always free, so you can try it out and see if you enjoy the lesson. Prices are £4 per session for adults and £3 per session for children.

I'd like families to be able to train together and understand it can be expensive when training in a large group. To combat this, I'm limiting the price to £10 for groups of three and £12 for groups of four.

Payment by bank transfer is preferred. Please [contact us](/contact/) for details.

## Cancellation Fees

Should you cancel with less than 24 hours notice, you will be charged for the lesson fee.

## Membership Fees

All students who train on a regular basis will need to join the [Japan Karate Association](https://www.jka.or.jp/en/) and get a licence. The licence fee is £35 / year. It includes a licence book, covers insurance and allows you to grade.

## Grading Fees

To get your next belt/grade, you must take a grading. This consists of you performing your techniques in front of an examiner, who will assess if you have reached the required level. Fees will vary depending on where the grading takes place and may include a training session beforehand. Kyu gradings (colour belts) are approximately £25.

Dan gradings (black belt) generally require examiners from JKA HQ, and can be upwards of £100.

## Funding
Northstowe Karate Club has been awarded funding to help with the running costs of the club. The club wants to be as accessible as possible, and has allocated some of this funding towards helping those on lower incomes attend. We are able to support up to 4 students with:

* 1 annual membership
* A dogi (uniform) plus belt
* First grading

If you would like to apply, please [get in touch](/contact/) for a confidential conversation. The application is self‑assessed, so no evidence is required. Unfortunately, we cannot assist with lesson fees, but we may be able to reach an agreement, so please get in touch.
