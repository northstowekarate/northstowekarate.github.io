# Fees at Northstowe Karate Club

## Lesson Fees

There are no monthly minimums — you only pay for the sessions you attend.

The first lesson is always free, so you can try it out and see if you enjoy the lesson. Prices are £4 per session for adults and £3 per session for children.

### Group Discounts
Families can train together at a discounted rate, as training as a large familiy can be expensive. Max £10 for a family of 3, and £12 for a family of 4. 

## Dogi (Karate Uniforms)

Beginner uniforms can be bought through the club and range from £15-£25, based on size. You do not have to purchase through the club. Our only requirement is that the dogi is **white**. We usually recommend one of the following:

* [Blitz Children's Beginner Karate gi](https://www.blitzsport.com/karate/karate-suits-uniforms/blitz-kids-lightweight-karate-gi)
* [Blitz Adults Beginner Karate gi](https://www.blitzsport.com/karate/karate-suits-uniforms/blitz-adult-lightweight-karate-gi)
* [Bytomic Children's Beginner karate gi](https://www.bytomic.com/products/white-bytomic-red-label-7oz-lightweight-kids-karate-uniform)
* [Bytomic Adult Beginner karate gi](https://www.bytomic.com/products/white-bytomic-red-label-7oz-lightweight-adult-karate-uniform)

## Gradings

To get your next belt/grade, you must take a grading. This consists of you performing your techniques in front of an examiner, who will assess if you have reached the required level. Fees will vary depending on where the grading takes place and may include a training session beforehand. Kyu gradings (colour belts) are approximately £25. There are generally 3 gradings per year.

### Dan gradings

Dan gradings (black belt) generally require examiners from JKA HQ, and can be upwards of £100. These are typically held at national and internation courses, often in Windsor and Paisley.

## Funding
Northstowe Karate Club has been awarded funding to help with the running costs of the club. The club wants to be as accessible as possible, and has allocated some of this funding towards helping those on lower incomes attend. We are able to support up to 4 students with:

* 1 annual membership
* A dogi (uniform) plus belt
* First grading

If you would like to apply, please [get in touch](/contact/) for a confidential conversation. The application is self‑assessed, so no evidence is required. Unfortunately, we cannot assist with lesson fees, but we may be able to reach an agreement, so please get in touch.
