### Membership Fees

All students who train on a regular basis will need to be members of the [Japan Karate Association](https://jka.or.jp). Membership is £35 / year, includes a license book and allows you to grade.

### Grading Fees

To get your next belt/grade you must take a grading. This consists of you performing your techniques in front of an examiner, who will asses if you have reached the required level. Fees will vary depending on where the grading takes places and may include a training session beforehand. Kyu gradings (colour belts) are approximately £25.

Dan gradings (black belt) generally require examiners from JKA HQ, and can be upwards of £100.
