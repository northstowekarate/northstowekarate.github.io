# Frequently Asked Questions

## It's my first lesson, what can I expect? 

This is a very common question. For detailed information, please view our ["What to Expect" page](/training/whattoexpect/). In brief, your first lesson will introduce you to the basics of karate, including fundamental stances, punches, and kicks. You'll also learn about dojo etiquette and the importance of respect and discipline in martial arts. Our instructors will ensure you feel comfortable and supported throughout the session.

## What should I wear? 

You don't need a gi (karate uniform) to start. Please wear loose-fitting clothes to your first session. Comfortable athletic wear, such as a t-shirt and sweatpants, is ideal. As you progress, you may choose to invest in a gi, which can enhance your training experience and help you feel more integrated into the karate community.

## What are the age requirements? 
We teach both children and adults, aged 8 and above. We will take students aged 6-7 on a case by case basis. There's no upper age limit, so it's never too late to start learning karate. We recommend that young children (6/7) train alongside their parents for the first few sessions to build their confidence gradually. This family-oriented approach can also strengthen bonds and create a supportive learning environment.

## Will I get hurt? 

Karate is a martial art, and there are some risks involved. However, injuries are rare. JKA karate is non-contact, and you won't be expected to fight until you've mastered the basics. We build up the level of fighting gradually, starting off slowly with known attacks to develop technique and confidence. Safety is our top priority, and our instructors are trained to ensure that all activities are conducted in a controlled and safe manner.
