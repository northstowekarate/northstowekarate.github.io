# Frequently Asked Questions

## It's my first lesson, what can I expect?
This is a very common question. Please view our [what to expect](/training/whattoexpect/) page for details.

## What should I wear?
You don't need a gi (karate uniform) to start. Please wear loose fitting clothes to your first session.

## What are the age requirements
We teach both children and adults, aged 6+. There's no upper age limit. We recommend young children train alongside their parents for the first few sessions so they can build their confidence gradually.

## Will I get hurt?
Karate is a martial art and there are some [risks](/policies/risk/) involved. However, injuries rarely occur. JKA karate is non-contact and you won't be expected to fight until you've mastered the basics and we build up the level of fighting gradually, starting off slowly with known attacks to build up technique and confidence.
