<h2>Age requirements</h2>
<p>
We teach students from the age of 8, but will take students aged 6-7 on a case-by-case basis. Young children should train alongside a parent or guardian for the first few lessons while they gain experience in the unfamiliar environment. If a parent / guardian does not wish to train alongside their young child, they must remain close by.
