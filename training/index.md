# Training Sessions

## When and where 
Training has not yet started. Please register your interest by [contacting us](/contact). Lessons will be 1 hour long on Wednesday evenings held in Northstowe.

## Prices
The first lesson is always free, so you can try it out and see if you enjoy the lesson. After that prices are still to be determined but in the region of Â£3-6 a lesson.

# What to expect
Although each lesson will differ, training consists of 3 key elements.

## Kihon (basics)
Kihon consists of performing basic techniques, without a partner, multiple times to improve the effectiveness of the technique and to gain better understanding of how these techniques work. Techniques include blocking, punching and kicking.

## Kata (forms)
A kata is a set of moves performed in a specific order in order to help develop technique, control of the body and timing. More advanced study of the kata leads to investigation of the techniques performed and potential application (bunkai).

## Kumite (sparing)
Kumite is the practice of techniques with an opponent. Students will generally build up their kihon first before kumite practice is considered. This can be intimidating at first, but is built up overtime, starting in controlled conditions - where the techniques are predetermined up to freestyle where the techniques are completely free.

# FAQs

## What to wear
You don't need a gi (karate uniform) to start. Please wear loose fitting clothes to your first session.
