# What to expect
We teach traditional [Shotokan Karate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotokan), a Japanese style of karate, which is one of the most popular around the world. We are are a member of [Japan Shotokan Karate England](https://jske.co.uk) and are affiliated with the [Japan Karate Association](https://www.jka.or.jp/en/). 

Although each lesson will differ, training consists of 3 key elements.

## Kihon (basics)
Kihon consists of performing basic techniques, without a partner, multiple times to improve the effectiveness of the technique and to gain better understanding of how these techniques work. Techniques include blocking, punching and kicking.

## Kata (forms)
A kata is a set of moves performed in a specific order in order to help develop technique, control of the body and timing. More advanced study of the kata leads to investigation of the techniques performed and potential application (bunkai).

## Kumite (sparring)
Kumite is the practice of techniques with an opponent. Students will generally build up their kihon first before kumite practice is considered. This can be intimidating at first, but is built up overtime, starting in controlled conditions - where the techniques are predetermined up to freestyle where the techniques are completely free.

# FAQs

## What to wear
You don't need a gi (karate uniform) to start. Please wear loose fitting clothes to your first session.
