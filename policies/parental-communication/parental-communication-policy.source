# Policy

This policy outlines how Northstowe Karate Club will communicate with parents and guardians to ensure transparency, trust, and effective safeguarding for all children and young people participating in club activities.

## **1. Purpose**

The purpose of this policy is to establish clear expectations and procedures for engaging with parents/guardians regarding their child's participation, welfare, and development within the club.

## **2. Guiding Principles**

- Parents and guardians are essential partners in supporting the wellbeing and progress of young members.
- Communication will be timely, respectful, and age-appropriate to the needs of both the child and their parent/carer.
- All communication must comply with data protection laws and safeguarding best practice.

## **3. Communication Channels**

- Club communication will primarily take place via email, phone calls, secure online platforms, or in-person meetings.
- Where messaging apps or social media are used for group announcements, communication will be strictly controlled and monitored.
- One-to-one digital communication between adults and children is prohibited unless a parent/guardian is included or prior written consent has been obtained.

## **4. Routine Communication**

- Information on training schedules, cancellations, events, competitions, and fees will be shared in advance using agreed channels.
- Updates on a child's progress, attendance, or concerns will be shared with parents in a timely and appropriate manner.
- All official club information must come from verified club accounts, not personal devices or unapproved staff.

## **5. Consent & Data Handling**

Parental consent will be obtained for all communications involving children, including photos, travel, and use of digital platforms.

Contact details and records will be securely stored and only accessed by authorised staff.

## **6. Emergencies & Welfare Concerns**

- Parents will be contacted immediately in the event of an emergency, accident, or safeguarding concern involving their child.
- If a child discloses abuse or distress, staff will follow safeguarding procedures, which may include notifying external agencies in addition to parents.

## **7. Meetings & Feedback**

- Parents are encouraged to contact the club with questions, feedback, or concerns and can request a meeting with the welfare team.
- All feedback will be acknowledged, and complaints will be handled in line with the club's Complaints Policy.

## **8. Boundaries & Conduct**

- Club staff must maintain professional boundaries in all interactions with parents and guardians.
- Abusive, threatening, or inappropriate behaviour by any party will not be tolerated and may lead to restricted communication access or club sanctions.

## **9. Monitoring & Review**

This policy will be reviewed annually or following any significant communication issue. All communication concerns should be reported to the club's safeguarding lead or welfare officer.
