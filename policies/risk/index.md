## Assumption of Risk
 
Martial arts – as with all sports – carry an inherent risk of injury or harm and it is essential that you are fully aware of these dangers before taking part in our class. Please read carefully the following document and continue only if you understand the risks and are happy to proceed.

Martial Arts carry inherent risks. Whilst your instructor will always do what is possible to minimise these risks and mitigate the possibility of harm occurring, there are certain dangers that are unavoidable. Because of the nature of martial arts – and unarmed combat training – combined with martial arts based fitness training, you will be exposed to many potential risks throughout your time training with Northstowe Karate Club. These include, but are not limited to, Slips, Trips, Sprains, Falls, Cuts, Abrasions, Contusions, Swelling and in some more uncommon cases, breaks and other injuries. Whilst the club’s safety record is [exemplary] it’s important to us that you understand the nature of what you are about to participate in, and that you are happy to assume all risks having been made aware in advance of what these might be. We train primarily in the style of Shotokan Karate. We also combine fitness drills into most of our training, with some key martial arts based fitness and martial arts based conditioning too. You always have the right to stop training at any point should you not feel comfortable performing any set technique or exercise, and you are under no pressure to complete any drill, technique or exercise if you do not wish to.  If you do continue with this class and any subsequent classes we ask that you take a moment to consider the nature of an intense combat class and what that might entail, including the above possible risks as identified – and any other potential injuries, such as contact during sparring, concussion, breaks and others. These are very uncommon – but they can occur. Please ensure you’re happy to assume the inherent risks that come with training in martial arts.

You are welcome and encouraged to speak to your instructor if you’re not completely at ease with the risks being assumed, or not completely confident about what our classes entail.
