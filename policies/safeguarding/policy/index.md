# Northstowe Karate Club - Safeguarding Policy

Last Updated/Reviewed – [09/2025]

This document must be reviewed no less than once per year.

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to set out how Northstowe Karate Club protects children and young persons and/or adults at risk from harm during their training within the club. This includes harm arising from abuse of all kinds, including sexual, physical and emotional abuse, neglect, bullying and any other forms of violence or exploitation.

This policy lays out Northstowe Karate Club's responsibilities and the reporting mechanisms, to ensure that instructors, parents, students and members of the public are confident reporting a concern and, for staff, to take appropriate action.

To be clear, Safeguarding is defined as “protecting a persons’ health, well-being and human rights, and enabling them to live free from harm, abuse and neglect”. In martial arts, this will typically apply to children and young persons, and adults at risk.

## Scope Of This Policy

This policy shall be effective and mandatory for all staff, instructors, volunteers, and visiting instructors. This policy shall also be effective for all visitors and parents of Northstowe Karate Club.

## Policy Statement

Northstowe Karate Club believes that everyone we come into contact with, regardless of age, gender identity, disability, sexual orientation or ethnic origin has the right to be protected from all forms of harm, abuse, neglect and exploitation. Northstowe Karate Club will not tolerate abuse and exploitation by staff or associated personnel. Northstowe Karate Club remains committed to ensuring the effective prevention, reporting and response to any safeguarding concerns raised or detected.

## Prevention

In order to provide vulnerable groups with the best possible experience and opportunities within martial arts, Northstowe Karate Club operates in line with the BMABA national safeguarding policy. This includes ensuring best practice is met at all times in relation to safeguarding and risk management. A core part of Northstowe Karate Club's prevention strategy is to ensure that the following is met in terms of minimum best practice guidance at all times;

* Instructors are expected to comply with BMABA association national frameworks and regulatory guidelines in respect of minimum standards, best practice and compulsory safeguarding obligations.
* Instructors must always hold the minimum grade required to competently and technically deliver the class in question, with additional qualifications as necessary for specialist styles or roles.
* Instructors must all hold the necessary Public Liability insurance, a valid first aid qualification and both an enhanced DBS check within 3 years from date of issue, and an in-date safeguarding qualification relevant to the group(s) being taught.
* Treat all young persons aged under 18 years of age, and all vulnerable adults, with respect, dignity and courtesy.
* Treat all children and / or vulnerable adults equally.
* Always put the welfare of children and / or vulnerable adults first.
* Always work in an open environment avoiding any isolation, unobserved situation, encouraging an open and transparent club community.
* Keep physical contact to an absolute minimum.
* Never be alone with a child and / or vulnerable adult.
* Where physical contact is essential as part of the safe and structured learning process of the art, discipline or sport being practiced, the instructor and/or teaching person must only do so with the consent of the child and/or vulnerable adult, remaining appropriate, non intrusive and ensuring that where physical contact is essential (for example, when assisting in an essential physical process for the purposes of safety, such as break-falls) ensuring there is always two fully vetted and suitable adults present at all times.
* The involvement of parents / guardians is encouraged wherever possible, provided safeguarding of children and / or vulnerable adults remains the top priority and that any adult may not be given the opportunity to cause harm, distress or abuse to any children and / or vulnerable adults present.
* Not take photographs, videos or create any other forms of media featuring any children and / or vulnerable adults without consent from the carer, guardian or parents in advance.
* Ensure that if the club embarks on any extra-curricular activities, safeguarding of children and / or vulnerable adults shall remain a top priority and furthermore, if classes are mixed in gender, both a vetted male and female member of the club must be present when out of the dojo.
* Remain an excellent role model both in and out of the dojo. This includes not smoking, drinking alcohol or using any foul language in front of any children and / or vulnerable adults.
* Ensure that any contact via social media or other digital formats are recorded and minimised. No instructor and/or club official should have any communication with children and / or vulnerable adults via any forms of social media.
* Recognise the development needs and capacity of the children and / or vulnerable adults in the class and not risk sacrificing welfare or safety for the club or instructor’s personal gain.
* In relation to the above this also means avoiding excessive training and / or competitions and not pushing the student if they are not fully confident.
* Keep thorough records of any injuries or near misses that have occurred, along with details of any treatment given and further communication had with parents / guardians and/or children and / or vulnerable adults.
* Follow association guidelines and other association policy relating to good practice or best practice

Northstowe Karate Club remains committed to ensuring prevention via professional, competent club governance at all times.


## Raising Concerns Or Making A Disclosure

Northstowe Karate Club will always ensure that in any case where a child or vulnerable adult might directly confide to any form of abuse, that the club must take immediate steps to safeguard that person effectively.   Where concerns are raised by a third party, or by suspicions held by the instructor or club, the below checklist shall be maintained wherever possible but in all instances, the club will escalate and report in full on all occasions.

If a child or vulnerable adults indicates that they are being abused, the instructor to whom the disclosure is made will;

* Stay calm so as not to frighten the child or vulnerable adult.
* Reassure the child or vulnerable adult that they are not to blame and that it was right to inform.
* Listen to the child or vulnerable adult, showing that they are being taken seriously.
* Keep questions to a minimum so that there is a clear and accurate understanding of what has been said.  The law is very strict and child / vulnerable adult abuse cases have been dismissed where it is felt that the child or vulnerable adult has been led or words and ideas have been suggested during questioning. Accordingly, the instructor must only ask questions to clarify details – not to question further.
* Inform the child or vulnerable adult that the instructor will have to inform other people about what they have disclosed.  The instructor must ensure the child or vulnerable adult understands this is in confidence, on a needs-must basis and is to help stop the abuse continuing.
* Safety of the child or vulnerable adult is paramount.  If the child or vulnerable adult needs urgent medical attention, the instructor will call an ambulance, inform the doctors of the concern and ensure they are made aware that this is a child protection / safeguarding issue.
* Record all information
* Report the incident to the club/welfare officer and, where appropriate to the association without delay


If the instructor / club is not clear on what action is required and there is a real or immediate threat to the child or vulnerable adult, they should contact the Police on 999. Where there is confusion on what should happen next, the instructor should not delay by contacting the association and should instead contact a relevant statutory authority, such as the local authority designated officer (LADO) or the NSPCC on their 24 hour help line, the number of which will be publicly available.
