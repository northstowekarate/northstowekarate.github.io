<h2>What to expect</h2>
<p>
Although no two lessons are the same, our <a href="/training/whattoexpect">lesson format</a> is usually structured around kihon (basic techniques), kumite (sparring) and kata (forms). We build up your confidence gradually. We're a non-contact club and you won't be expected to fight until you've learnt the basics and even then it's under controlled conditions with known attacks and blocks until you're very experienced. Injuries are rare - please speak to the instructor if you have any concerns.
