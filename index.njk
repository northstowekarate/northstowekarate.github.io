<h1>Northstowe Karate Club</h1>
<p>
Northstowe Karate Club teaches traditional Shotokan Karate and is a member of the <a href="https://jka.or.jp/en">Japan Karate Association</a>. We're based in Northstowe, on the outskirts of Cambridge. We're a family friendly club, where children (6+) and adults can both train together. We have <a href="/training">regular sessions</a> on Wednesday evenings from 1830-1930. 
</p>

<p>Your first lesson is always free, and after that you <a href="/training/fees">pay per session</a>. To book your first class please <a href="/contact/">get in touch</a>. Please arrive 5 minutes early for your first session so you can be registered.
</p>

<p>
Although no two lessons are the same, our <a href="/training/whattoexpect">lesson format</a> is usually structured around kihon (basic techniques), kumite(sparring) and kata(forms). We build up your confidence gradually. We're a non-contact club and you won't be expected to fight until you've learnt the basics and even then it's under controlled conditions with known attacks and blocks until you're very experienced.
</p>

<p>Simon Apen-Sadler, the chief <a href="/instructors">instructor</a>, has over 20 years experience, is first aid qualified and has a fully enhanced DBS check.
