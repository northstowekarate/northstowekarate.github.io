<h2>Welcome to Northstowe Karate Club</h2>
<p>
At Northstowe Karate Club, we are committed to teaching traditional Shotokan Karate in a supportive and friendly environment. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced practitioner, our club offers a place for everyone to learn, grow, and achieve their personal best.
</p>

<h2>About the club</h2>
<p>
Our club teaches traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotokan">Shotokan Karate</a>, a Japanese martial art, in Northstowe on the outskirts of Cambridge. We are a member of <a href="https://jske.co.uk">Japan Shotokan Karate England</a> and are affiliated with the <a href="https://www.jka.or.jp/en/">Japan Karate Association</a>, which is one of the largest and most prestigious karate organisations in the world.
</p>
<h2>Training</h2>
<p>
We're a family friendly club, where children (8+) and adults can both train together. We will consider students aged 6-7 on a case-by-case basis. Regular <a href="/training/">training sessions</a> are held on Wednesday evenings from 1830-1930 at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/CMxjFnhDTKZ8YbDB6">The Cabin</a>. We recommend young children train alongside their parent/guardian for the first few lessons while they gain confidence in the unfamiliar environment.

<h2>What to expect</h2>
<p>
Although no two lessons are the same, our <a href="/training/whattoexpect/">lesson format</a> is usually structured around kihon (basic techniques), kumite (sparring) and kata (forms). We build up your confidence gradually. We're a non-contact club, and you won't be expected to fight until you've learnt the basics, and even then it's under controlled conditions with known attacks and blocks until you're very experienced. Injuries are rare - please speak to the instructor if you have any concerns. There is an element of risk to all sports and exercise, including martial arts - please see our <a href="/policies/risk/">assumption of risk document</a> for details.
