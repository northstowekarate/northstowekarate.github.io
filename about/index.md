# About Northstowe Karate Club

Founded in 2024 by Simon Apen-Sadler [(Chief Instructor)](/instructors/), Deborah Turner (Treasurer), and Mitali Apen-Sadler (Secretary), Northstowe Karate Club is a welcoming martial arts community based on the principles of budo karate: discipline, humility, and continuous self-improvement.

We teach traditional [Shotokan Karate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotokan), a Japanese martial art. We are a member of [Japan Shotokan Karate England](https://jske.co.uk) and are affiliated with the [Japan Karate Association](https://www.jka.or.jp/en/), which is one of the largest and most prestigious karate organisations in the world.

## Family Friendly

At Northstowe Karate Club, we pride ourselves on being a family-friendly and inclusive community where everyone aged 8 and above is welcome to train, learn, and grow together. Whether you're a complete beginner or have years of experience, our classes are designed to support mixed abilities, ensuring that each student progresses at their own pace in a safe and encouraging environment. Families often train side by side, building confidence, discipline, and fitness while sharing a unique and rewarding journey.

We believe karate is for everyone - regardless of age, background, or physical ability. Our instructors foster a respectful and supportive atmosphere where diversity is celebrated and every member feels valued. From children developing coordination and focus to adults seeking fitness or self-defence skills, Northstowe Karate Club offers a space where personal growth and community spirit go hand in hand.

## Tradition and Respect — Rooted in Honour, Strengthened by Community

We believe karate is more than physical technique — it’s a lifelong journey of character development. Our training is grounded in tradition and respect, with honour guiding how we teach, train, and support each other. Community is at the heart of everything we do.

## What is budo?
Budo (武道), meaning “the martial way,” represents a philosophy of personal growth through martial arts. It encourages focus, resilience, and mutual respect — values we aim to instil in every student.

Simon brings decades of experience and regularly trains with senior [Japan Karate Association (JKA)](https://www.jka.or.jp/en/) instructors on official JKA courses. The club is proudly affiliated with both [Japan Shotokan Karate England (JSKE)](https://jske.co.uk/) and the JKA, ensuring our teaching stays true to authentic Shotokan karate.

**What to expect in training:**
- Clear instruction in strong fundamentals
- Practical self-defence techniques
- A focus on steady personal progress

For more information see our [what to expect page](/training/what-to-expect/).

We welcome children, teens, and adults of all experience levels. Whether you're trying karate for the first time or returning to deepen your practice, you'll find a friendly, inclusive environment where everyone is supported and challenged.
