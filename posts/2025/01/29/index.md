# 2025-01-29 Lesson Summary - Front Stance

## Choku Zuki

We started off practicing choku zuki - straight punch, practicing how to make a fist, hikite (pulling the hand back to the hip), and twisting your fist at the end of the punch. 

## Zenkustu Dachi

Zenkutsu Dachi, front stance, has 60% weight on the front leg, feet are shoulder width part and two shoulder widths long. We practiced stepping forwards and turning. Key things to focus on are keeping the hips at the same height and expanding by extending the rear leg to generate power and push yourself forward.

## Oi Zuki

We put choku zuki and stepping in front stance to make oi zuki - stepping punch. Stepping allows us close the distance between us and our opponent. The greater distance also allows us to generate more power.

## Outside block and kumite
We practiced outside block, which is used to deflect an incoming middle level (chudan) punch. Practicing with a partner with a basic drill introduced you to kumite - there are more advanced drills, up to and including jiyu kumite (freestyle).

## Kata
We finished off practicing multiple kata - kihon, heian shodan, heian nidan and heian sandan. We have videos of the first 6 kata on our [heian kata page](/kata/heian/).
