# Lesson Summary - 26th Feb 2025

## Basic Techniques
We started off the lesson with a warm up followed by some basic techniques on the spot - age uke and soto uke.

## Sparring on the spot
To simplify things, we started off practicing kumite on the spot, facing each other while one side attacked and the other would block the attack. This also helped you get the timing correct, so you were not blocking too early or too late.

## Without a partner
Next, we moved on to practicing the steps and techniques involved in sanbon kumite - stepping forward and punching 3 times, stepping backwards and blocking 3 times.

## Putting it all together
Finally, we put everything together and practiced 3 step sparring - attacking and blocking 3 times to the face and body.

## Sanbon Kumite - Key Points
* Start and finish with rei (bowing)
### When attacking:
* Ensure you are punching to the correct target
* Ensure you are at the correct distance - the attacker sets the initial distance
* Perform techniques with speed and power and with kiai on the final technique

* Step back when finishing

### When defending:
* Wait for your opponent and get your timing right
