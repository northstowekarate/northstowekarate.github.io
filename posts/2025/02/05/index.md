# Lesson Summary - 5th Feb
## Kokutsu Dachi (Back Stance)
We focused on back stance (kokutsu dachi). This is a particularly difficult stance, especially for beginners. Key points of back stance are:

* 70% weight on the rear leg
* Feet in an L shape (feet perpendicular)
* A soft hip on the back leg (like your going to sit down, but with a straight back)

We practiced stepping forwards and turning (on the heel). First your weight drops on your supporting leg (sasae ashi) with a soft hip and feet perpendicular. You then slide the other leg forwards, keeping the weight on the supporting leg.

### Shuto (Sword Hand)
Shuto (sword hand) is typically performed in back stance. We straight the fingers, keeping them tight together and keeping the thumb tight and slightly bent. We strike with the flesh part of the hand between the knuckle of the little finger and the wrist. The hand comes from next to the ear down to chest level in a chopping and twisting motion.

## Sanbon Kumite
Kumite (sparring) is done with a partner. We practiced the steps and techniques without a partner so we can get used to this. We will practice this again soon, with a partner. I demonstrated what this would like like but we did not have time to practice this fully.

## Kata

We then practiced our kata. Beginners practiced the first kata (kihon kata) a.k.a. taikyoku shodan. Others practiced up to heian sandan. We practiced theses kata, in part, to help prepare for the grading. We do not have long to go! You can find [videos of the kata](/kata/heian/) so you can learn an practice at home.
