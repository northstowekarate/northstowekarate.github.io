# Lesson Summary - 19th Feb 2025
## Sanbon Kumite
## Kihon - Basic Techniques
We started off the lesson, practicing all the basic techniques required for 3 step sparring. We started practicing these techniques on the spot:
* Jodan Choku Zuki - face level straight punch
* Chudan Choku Zuki - middle level straight punch
* Gedan Barai - lower sweep
* Age Uke - rising block
* Soto Uke - outside block

We then moved on to practicing these techniques in the same order as sanbon kumite, stepping both forward and backwards.

## Sanbon Kumite
We then practiced sanbon kumite, performing the same techniques performed previously with a partner. One person would attack 3 times while the other would defend 3 times and counter punch. First to the face, and the second round to the stomach.
