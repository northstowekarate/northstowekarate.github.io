# Lesson Summary - 5th Mar 2025

With just two and a half weeks until the grading, this will be our focus until then. There are 3 elements to grading - kihon, kumite and kata. You can find out what you have to do for your grading in the [grading syllabus](/kyu-syllabus/).

## Kihon
We started off practicing our basic techniques - stepping punch, rising block, outside block and mae geri. We also went through gedan barai, shuto uke. Some of you also practiced side kicks. Key points to note:

* Low stances (not necessarily longer, but bend your knees more)
* Hand tight on your hip
* Snap the foot back when performing a snap kick (mae geri - front kick)

## Kumite
We practiced both sanbon and gohon kumite (3 and 5 step) for both face and stomach attacks. 

## Kata
We practiced kihon kata and heian shodan. Advanced grades practiced heian nidan and heian sandan. Please practice your katas at home. You can view [videos of the kata](/kata/heian/) to help remember them.
