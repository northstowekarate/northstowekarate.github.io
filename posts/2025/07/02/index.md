# Lesson Summary - 2nd July 2025

It was a busy class and we had a lot to cover. We started off practicing some basic techniques - choku zuki, age uke, soto uke and mae geri - the four basic techniques in for the 9th Kyu syllabus. We practiced these first on the spot and then adding stepping and turning in zenkutsu dachi and gedan barai.

We then moved on to sanbon kumite, practicing it first without a partner and then with. This is also required for the 9th Kyu grading.

We then finished with kata. We went through kihon kata multiple times to give many of you the chance to learn it. We then went through some more advanced kata focusing on specific parts to help you improve.
