# Lesson Summary - 9th July 2025

We continued to prepare for the upcoming grading by going through the syllabus. Please continue to practice at home to prepare for the upcoming grading, in particular practice your kata. 

## Club is 1 year old

Our first session was held on 2024-07-03. It has been great to see so many of you start your karate journey, and see you grow and improve in both confidence and skill. I hope you enjoy the classes and continue to progress in the years to come.

We finished the lesson with some sweet treats to celebrate.

Thank you to Deborah and Mitali for helping out with behind the scenes admin!
