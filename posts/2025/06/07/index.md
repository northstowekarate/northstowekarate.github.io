# Grading - 7th June 2025

## Training

We had almost a 100 students train with Sensei Roy Tomlin MBE (7th Dan JKA, 6th Dan JKA) this weekend at Cambridge Karate Dojo.

## Advanced Lesson
The first hour was a lesson with Sensei Roy Tomlin. The focus was on punching, in particular the course of the punch and distance, practicing ura zuki, tate zuki and oi zuki at various distances.

Note that the forearm does not rotate until the elbow leaves the body.

## Beginners Lesson

The next hour also started with punching and the course of the punch, but then moved on to other basic techniques and gohon, sanbon and kihon ippon kumite.

## Grading

75 students graded from Cambridge University Karate Club, Northstowe Karate Club and Cambridge Karate Dojo. The standard was very high all 75 students, including 10 from Northstowe Karate Club, passed. Congratulations!
