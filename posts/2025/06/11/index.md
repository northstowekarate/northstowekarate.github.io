# Lesson Summary - 11th June 2025

We started off with choku zuki, zenkutsu dachi and how to step. We then put these together to perform oi zuki (stepping punch) and moving on to soto uke (outside block). This demonstrated the first 'k' of karate - kihon.

Once you had the basic idea, we partnered up and practiced blocking each others punches. Partnering with someone is called kumite (the second k). Some students then gave a demonstration of gohon kumite - 5 step sparring - a slightly more advanced version of kumite.

We then moved on to kata (the 3rd k). We practiced all 20 moves, with key points being turning in the correct direction. 

This will have given you a brief introduction to what karate is all about - kihon, kumite and kata.
