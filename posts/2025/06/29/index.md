# Lesson Summary - 29th June 2025

This weekend we focused on kihon and heian kata, going through kihon, heian nidan and heian yondan, in preparation for the upcoming grading.

Many of you are still learning the moves of kihon kata, so you have to practice at home.

For heian nidan, the first 6 moves must be fast and strong. It's also important to practice gyaku y position, with the hips angled 45 degrees inside when performing gyaku uchi uke.

For heian yondan we have a combination for fast and slow moves. We need to ensure there's a clear difference to ensure the correct timing and rhythm of the techniques. Key moves include 5-10, performing keage and uraken followed by an elbow strike - you must ensure your hips are engaged and you don't fall into the elbow strike.
