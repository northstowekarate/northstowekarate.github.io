# Lesson Summary - 25th June 2025

After a quick warm up, we started looking at hip rotation and then moved on to blocking and countering (gyaku zuki). Your hips should rotate parallel to the floor. Neither knee should move as you rotate, with your thighs moving. 

When countering, use the rear leg to drive the hip forward when punching.

We then moved on to side snap kick and side thrust kick. Both kicks use the outside edge of the foot. With snap kick, the knee remains in place and the leg snaps out and back with simultaneous hip rotation, like a pendulum, to enable you to kick with the edge of the foot and the toes.

With thrust kick, the knee drives into the opponent, the whole leg and hip turning like a corkscrew.

In both kicks the supporting leg rotates to enable you to engage your hips correctly.
