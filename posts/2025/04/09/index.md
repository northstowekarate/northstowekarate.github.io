# Lesson Summary - 9th Apr 2025

## Kihon

We went through our basic techniques from choku zuki to yoko geri keage. Repetition is key to becoming better so we will continue to practice these over and over again.

## Kata

When learning a kata, it's best to break it down in to sections. Heian Kata are all < 30 moves, so we split them into 2 to help you remember. We practiced kihon and heian shodan, nidan, sandan and yondan a few times each. Right now, we are practicing the moves to help you memorise them. Once you have them we can focus on improving the kata making stronger and faster.
