# Lesson Summary - 30th Apr 2025

Today we started off our lesson with kihon, practicing choku zuki (straight punch) and soto uke (outside block). We then moved on to zenkutsu dachi and putting the two together. It's important to remain at the same height and not come up and down when stepping forward and backward.

We the moved on to kata. We practiced kihon kata, on the spot. When performing this, we want to quickly shift feet on the spot, remaining at the same height. However, it can also be a good exercise to jump high between moves to increase fitness and increase explosive power (it's also fun too). We then split the class into the various different kata for different levels.
