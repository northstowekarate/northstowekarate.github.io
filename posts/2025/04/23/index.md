# Lesson Summary - 23rd Apr 2025

A big thank you to Sensei Joe for teaching the class while I was away. Sensei Joe has provided me with some notes so I can summarise the lesson below.

## Kihon

The class started off with choku zuki (straight punch) to warm up, followed by some more basic techniques: oi zuki - stepping forward and punching and then back into heisoku dachi (heels and toes touching) and mae geri (front kick) to the face (jodan) and stomach (chudan).

## Kumite

Next, on to kumite with a partner. Practiced soto uke (outside block) - there was an emphasis on zanshin (awareness) and ensuring you are focused on your opponent at all times - otherwise you might be hit while not paying attention! Once comfortable with this, moving on to blocking gedan barai/ gyaku counter from gyaku zuki attack - yori ashi (sliding both feet).

## Kata

Finally on to kata. The groups were split here based on grade, performing kata at the various levels. Beginners practiced kihon kata while, others practiced slightly higher level heian kata. These kata are usually performed on one side only, which becomes stronger. You practiced kata on the other side (mirror image), ensuring your techniques are strong on both sides. You finished performing kihon kata on both sides and then jumping on the spot.

It sounds like a great lesson Joe, so thanks again for teaching!
