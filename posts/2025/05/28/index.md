# Lesson Summary - 28th May 2025

We started the lesson practicing all the techniques on the spot, including mae geri, keage and kekomi. There were lots of kicks!

We then moved on to ido kihon (moving basics) required for your grading. Beginners will have done a lot more than required as I also have to prepare the senior grades.

We then moved on to practicing your kata. Please continue to practice this at home. I've seen some big improvements, but more work is needed on this.

We then finished with kumite.

Special shout-out to Moses, who finished the lesson. He has learnt the dojo kun in both English and Japanese. Well done!
