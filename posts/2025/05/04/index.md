# Lesson Summary - 4th May 2025

We practiced the kihon and kumite for the 1st and 7th kyu syllabus as well as heian nidan.

## Kihon 

The 7th Kyu syllabus introduces two new techniques - uchi uke (inside block) and yoko geri keage (side snap kick). 

We started with uchi uke, which is also used in heian nidan. The blocking hand starts in front of the opposite hip (palm down) and finishes in front of the shoulder (palm towards you). The elbow does not move and remains 1 fist distance away from the body as the forearm moves and rotates. We practices this on the spot before moving on to the rest of the kihon techniques. We practiced our kihon slowly at first and then speed. 

We also went through the 1st Kyu syllabus alongside the 7th kyu syllabus, practicing keage in particular. 

## Kumite

We went through gohon kumite as well as jiyu ippon kumite to count slowly to practice our distance.

For kihon kumite, the front foot must be inline with your opponents front foot to ensure correct distance. You must also ensure you aim for the correct target (face/stomach). For jiyu ippon, the distance is not set and you slide in and out, which we did to count.

## Kata

We practiced heian nidan several times. A key point includes gyaku hamni - where the hips are turned at a 45 degree angle in the opposite direction.
