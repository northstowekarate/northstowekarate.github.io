# JKA WF England Spring Camp 2025

It was a fantastic 3 days with over 8 hours of training, plus Dan grading and international license exams. We were taught by 3 of the best instructors in the world: Oishi Takeshi sensei (9th Dan), Chief Instructor of JKA; Kawasoe Masao sensei (8th Dan), Chief Instructor of JKA WF England; Naito Takeshi maestro (8th Dan), Chief Instructor of JKA Italy.

The course itself covered many topics and ideas to take home and practice including:
* Generate power from the floor, keeping the sole of the foot flat on the floor. Do not move you supporting foot before you move - this weakens the technique as power is generated in the wrong direction and slows you down
* Ensure your hands and feet finish moving at the same time
* Kumite practice
* Kicks, Kicks and more kicks
* Much more!

It was an intense 3 days of amazing training.
