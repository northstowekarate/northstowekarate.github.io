# Lesson Summary - 7th May 2025

## Kihon

Today we practiced lots of basic techniques required for your grading. We practiced them primarily on the spot today, trying to ensure correct form and technique. We practiced

### Arm Techniques

* Choku Zuki
  * The fist starts to turn as the elbow leaves the body
  * Practice your hip flick and using the floor to generate a powerful punch
* Age Uke
  * The fist goes diagonally in a straight line - the block deflects, as the arm is not going straight upwards
* Soto Uke
  * The feeling of the block is going forwards, again the block is a deflection forwards not going directly across
* Uchi Uke
  * The block starts from the opposite hip. The elbow does not move as you move the forearm across your body.
### Kicks

For all kicks, the first move is to raise your leg, keeping your foot tight and close to your body and ankle tight. For snap kicks, focus on pulling back (hiki ashi).

* Mae Geri
  * Kick to the front, with the ball of the foot
* Yoko Geri Keage
  * Kick to the side with sokuto, the edge of the foot
  * The foot rises in an arc, and with the hip twist at the end, the edge of the foot should be parallel to the floor

## Kumite

After practicing our blocks on the spot, we also practiced punching to the correct target and then blocking each others attacks on the spot.

## Kata

We finished practicing our grading kata ranging from kihon to tekki shodan.

## End

We also finished with mokusou and the dojo kun. This time in both Japanese and English. We will continue with this.
