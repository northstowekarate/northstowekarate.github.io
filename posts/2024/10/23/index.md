Tonight, we continued with some more advanced techniques and kata. We warmed up going through the first, 9th Kyu (orange belt), grading syllabus before moving on to side snap kick in horse riding stance (keage / kiba dachi), shuto uke / kokutsu dachi (sword hand block / back stance). We then finished off with kata performing heian nidan and kihon kata.

## Funding

The club has been awarded some funding. This will go towards equipment and hall fees. Additionally, we have some funding to help those on low income who usually wouldn't usually be able to afford to try new sports etc. We have funding for 4 new gis, annual memberships and first gradings. If you or someone you know could benefit from this funding, please let them know and we can have a confidential conversation. It will be self-assessed so there's no requirements to apply.
