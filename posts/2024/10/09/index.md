We had a slightly more advanced lesson again. We went through keage and Heian Nidan to start with, learning the basic pattern and moves.

We then went back to Kihon Kata, and thought about bunkai - kata application. What is each move and why are we doing it. The basic pattern is each block is against a kick and each punch is a counter attack. This was a very basic introduction into bunkai and how you should be thinking about each technique as if it were against an opponent. There are more accurate and realistic interpretations of each move, which we'll eventually move on to.
