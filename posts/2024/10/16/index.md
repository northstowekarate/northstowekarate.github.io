Tonight, we focused on mae-geri front kick. The key points of mae geri are:

* Raise the foot, not the knee. You want to keep the leg as bent as possible to create more power
* The toes must be back, with the foot pointed forward. You kick with the ball of the foot
* This is a snap kick. Focus 70% of the power on hiki-ashi (pulling the foot back)

We then moved on to shuto (sword hand) in back stance kokutsu dachi. Finishing with kihon kata.
