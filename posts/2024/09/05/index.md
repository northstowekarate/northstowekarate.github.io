# Northstowe Karate Club's 10th session

Thank you to everyone who attended. This is the last session of the initial 10 week course. I hope you enjoyed the course and will continue training with us.

Karate consists of the 3 K's - Kihon, Kumite and Kata. We've been building up over the past 10 weeks and performed all 3 tonight.

We started off with kihon, basic techniques. We practiced straight punch and stepping punch as well as rising and outside block. 

We moved on to sanbon kumite - attacking and defending stepping punches to the face and stomach.

Finally, we practiced kata, the first of 26 - Kihon Kata.
