# Lesson 2024-09-18 

We went back to basics this lesson, practicing chudan oi zuki (middle level stepping punch), soto uke (outside block) and zenkustu dachi (stepping forward and backwards). We broke the techniques down studying how to move quickly by compressing the supporting leg (jiku ashi) and expanding to generate power. We then took these techniques and practiced them against each other performing sanbon kumite.  We then practices kihon kata.
