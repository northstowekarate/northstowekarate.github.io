# Lesson Summary 2024-09-25 

As we had limited space, I gave the option of a basic or advanced lesson and by popular vote, we did the advanced lesson. We've previously practiced front and back stance. Today we started the lesson with kiba dachi - horse riding stance. This is a stance that is particularly strong from the side. We then moved on to yoko geri keage - side snap kick. With this kick, you use the side edge of the food. We also looked at the knee position, the snap and how to use the hips. We then finished off with kata, practicing the first half of heian nidan, followed by kihon kata.

Keage is a complicated and difficult kick, with many things going on! Everyone did well and it will become easier with practice!
