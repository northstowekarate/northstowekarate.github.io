Tonight, we started with 5 basic techniques on the spot with everyone counting to 10 each - straight punch, rising block, outside block, gedan barai and mae geri. We then practiced these techniques stepping forward in front stance and turning. There are a few tricks to moving fast:

1. Exhale throughout the entire technique
1. Relax throughout the entire technique - only tense at the end
1. Bend your front knee and use it to support your weight - No extra movements

We'll continue to practice this.

We then moved on to kumite. We practiced this both with and without a partner.

We ran out of time so only practiced kihon kata once - we will do more of this next week!
