This weeks lesson, we went through the grading syllabus for 9th Kyu, 8th Kyu and 7th Kyu. You can find the full grading syllabus [here](/kyu-syllabus/)

Each grading consists of 3 parts: basic techniques (Kihon), kata, and sparrking (kumite). Next week I will cover the grading syllabus again, with a focus on 3 step sparring. Please also practice your kata at home to ensure you know it well.
