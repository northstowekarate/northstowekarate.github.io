This weeks lesson, we focussed on kihon kata. I've added a section to the website with [videos on the kihon and the 5 heian kata](/kata/heian). We started off with the first 4 moves, then the first half up to the first kiai, and finally moving on to the second half.

We then went back to basics performing over 100 punches and 100 lower blocks - well done! Finally, we finished with kihon kata again - full speed and power.
