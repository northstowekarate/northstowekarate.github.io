# Northstowe Karate Club's 9th session

Tonight's session we focused on using our legs to generate power. When perform stepping punch (oi-zuki), we compress the front leg by moving the forward. As we step and the front leg becomes the rear leg we use the compression we've generated to push our bodies forward and perform a powerful punch. 

We then practiced front kick (mae geri) and kihon kata. The key points of mae geri are:
* Raise foot (not your kneed) first
* Snap the leg back - focus on hiki ashi (returning foot) and not kicking out
* Kick with the ball of the foot - toes back, ankle forward
