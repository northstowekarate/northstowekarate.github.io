## 6th session

Thank you to all who attended today's lesson. I hope you enjoyed it.

Today's lesson was split into three parts.

First, we covered some kihon focusing on turning behind which involves looking over our shoulder (always look first), moving our back leg across then turning and blocking gedan barai. The Japanese term for turning is [mawatte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8en-zWmtAoI).

Then we moved on to sanbon kumite (3 step sparring) practicing both attacking chudan oi zuki (middle level stepping punch) and blocking outside forearm block soto-ude-uke (soto uke / outside block for short). Here's a similar video on [gohon kumite (5 step sparring)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6RB3gW-_Po).

Finally, we moved on to kata: [kihon kata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJsSGHYF7_s) a.k.a. taikyoku shodan. This kata consists of 20 moves and the [embusen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embusen) forms a H shape on the floor.
