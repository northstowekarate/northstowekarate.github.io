# Second session

*Important Announcement*: Please let me know in advance if you're planning on attending next week (Wednesday 17th July). Only half the hall is available and we will have limited space. I will have to limit numbers. Please send me an [email](mailto:info@northstowekarate.com) if you plan on attending and I will let you know if you can attend.

Thank you to all who attended today. I hope you enjoyed the lesson. There's no need to attend all the sessions, so please feel free to attend future lessons if you haven't attended one already (space permitting).

Last week we focused on stepping punch (oi-zuki). This week we did a quick recap and then focused on rising block (age-uke), ensuring the arm is in the correct position. We then finished with kata: TAI-KYO-KU SHODAN; it's also called [KIHON KATA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJsSGHYF7_s). There's a [Northstowe Karate Club group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/468916798849946) on Facebook for any discussions/questions you may have or feel free to send me an email. Updates can also be found on our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61560001297561).
