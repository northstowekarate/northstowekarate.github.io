# Northstowe Karate Club's Third session

Thank you to everyone who attended the club's 3rd lesson. I hope you enjoyed the lesson. Apologies to those who could not attend due to lack of space. We have the full hall booked for our next 7 sessions, so please feel free to attend whenever you can. I hope to see you all next week.

We started off with a recap of previous techniques we've covered - straight punch (choku-zuki), rising block (age-uke), outside block (soto-uke), and gedan barai (lower sweep), before moving on to our first kick: front kick (mae-geri). We then continued with [TAIKYOKU SHODAN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJsSGHYF7_s) (Kihon Kata). We also went through [Heian Shodan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpUAkkrwNVs), which is very similar. There's a [Northstowe Karate Club group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/468916798849946) on Facebook for any discussions/questions you may have or feel free to send me an email. Updates can also be found on our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61560001297561).
