# Northstowe Karate Club's 5th session

Thank you to everyone who attended. 

In today's lesson we recapped some of the basic techniques, focusing on oi-zuki (stepping punch), age uke (rising block) and soto uke (outside block). We then focused on kumite (sparring), pairing up and practising these techniques against each other for the first time.
