# Northstowe Karate Club First Session

We have officially opened and had our first class! Thank you to all 13 who attended the Northstowe Karate Clubs first ever lesson. A special thank you to Joe who kindly helped teach, and my wife Mitali for help organising. I hope you enjoyed the lesson and hope to see you back next week. Please let your friends know about the club.

We covered 3 basic techniques today - oi zuki (stepping punch), gedan barai (lower sweep/block) and age uke (rising block). There's a [Northstowe Karate Club group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/468916798849946)  on Facebook for any discussions/questions you may have or feel free to send me an email.

We'll continue to train on Wednesdays 6.30-7.30pm at The Cabin for the next 9 weeks and if the attendance continues to be high, I'll extend this indefinitely.

## Fees

The first lesson is free and after than it's £3 for children and £4 for adults per lesson. I'm also offering an introductory discount - if you sign up for the fully 10 weeks now, the next 9 lessons are the price of 7. Alternatively, if you train as a family, you can get up to 2 children free with every adult who trains. 

I prefer payment via bank transfer. Please email me for the bank account details. Please use your name as a reference when making payments.

## Karate Uniforms

After a few weeks more weeks, I'll likely do a bulk purchase of gis (uniforms) for all the club - sizing and pricing is generally done by height. To give you an idea of pricing, an adult beginners lightweight gi can cost up to ~£40, although children's gis will likely be cheaper.

## Membership

Once you've determined if you want to continue karate, there will be an annual membership fee of around £35. You will need this to continue training and grade (get new belts).

I'll continue to post updates here and on the [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61560001297561), so please do check them out.
