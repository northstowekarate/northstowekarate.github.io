We continued to prepare for the grading, as this was the last lesson before. We went through 3 step sparring first, starting our without a partner. We then paired up and practiced blocking and counter punching. We then practiced our kihon and kata, ending with a mock grading. We went through 9th Kyu mock grading to explain how it is structured, how you will line up etc.
