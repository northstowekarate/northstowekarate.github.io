# 2024-12-11

As it was our last session of the year, I decided we should have a bit of fun. So we started out with some basics to warm up, focusing on punching and stepping - both oi zuki and gyaku zuki. We did some combinations on the punch pads. I focused on shifting weight from the back leg to the front leg to generate power. 

We then put this all together and I got out the break boards where you practiced your techniques - using your whole body and shifting your weight to generate power came in to play here.

We the finished off with a mince pie!
