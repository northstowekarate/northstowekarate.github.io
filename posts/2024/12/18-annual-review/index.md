# Annual Review 2024

## Opening

Northstowe Karate Club opened in July and has grown quickly. We had our first session 3rd July 2024 and has run 24 sessions since. We've had over 40 people come and try a free karate lesson, with over 22 returning for a second lesson (and more)! We've also had our first ever grading with 4/4 passes.

## High Attendance

Well done to our top attendees: Moses and Jasper have attended the most lessons (22), with Heather coming next (21) and Albert with (19). 

## Club Affiliation

The club has official registered with the [JKA](https://www.jka.or.jp/en/) and [JSKE](https://jske.co.uk) and we have 14 official members.

## Grading

We also attended our [first ever grading](/posts/2024/12/07/) at [Cambridge Karate Dojo](https://cambridgekaratedojo.com) where all 4 of our members passed.

## BMABA Club Colours and Safeguarding Code

As part of our commitment to excellence and quality, Northstowe Karate Club has attained the [BMABA](https://bmaba.org.uk) Club Colours Award. You can [verify the clubs status](https://bmaba.org.uk/verify/martial-arts-club-checker/). BMABA Club Colours is the UK Martial Artsâ€™ highest level of accreditation in terms of vetting and regulation. As part of this, we have also been awarded the [Safeguarding Code in Martial Arts](https://www.safeguardingcode.com/) by demonstrating our commitment to safeguarding of our students, ensuring best practices are in place.

## Thank you

A special thank you to my wife Mitali, Club secretary and Deborah, Treasurer who help with the running of the club behind the scenes.

I'd also like to thank JSKE, and in particular, Sensei Ken Hori, for all of the advice and support they have given the club.

A big thank you to all of our members who help make the club a success.
